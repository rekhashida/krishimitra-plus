## 🔗 Live Demo

**App:** [krishimitra-plus.netlify.app](https://krishimitra-plus.netlify.app)

> Try it yourself: sign up, register as a Farmer or Worker, scan a crop leaf photo for instant AI disease detection, post or find agricultural jobs nearby.

## 📖 The Problem

India's rural economy faces two disconnected crises:

- **Crop losses:** Farmers lose a significant share of their harvest every year to diseases that go undetected until it's too late, due to limited access to agricultural experts (roughly 1 extension officer per 1,000+ farmers).
- **Labour mismatch:** Over 25 crore unorganized agricultural workers struggle to find consistent, fairly-paid seasonal work, while farmers struggle to find reliable labour when they need it most.

Existing apps only solve half the problem — crop-disease apps don't help find workers, and job-matching apps aren't built for agriculture, don't work offline, and ignore India's literacy and language barriers.

## 💡 Our Solution

**KrishiMitra+** is a single platform that solves both problems together:

1. **AI Crop Disease Scanner** — point your phone camera at a leaf, get an instant diagnosis with organic and chemical remedy suggestions, read aloud in your language.
2. **AI-Powered Labour Marketplace** — farmers post work needs, workers get matched by location, skill, and crop experience, with an AI-driven fair-wage suggestion to prevent exploitation.

```

1. User uploads/captures a leaf photo in the **Crop Scanner**
2. Image is sent to a **Hugging Face Space** running our custom-trained model
3. The model returns the predicted disease + confidence score
4. The app looks up a local remedy database and displays organic/chemical treatment, cause, and prevention tips
5. Result is read aloud using the Web Speech API
6. Meanwhile, **Supabase** handles user authentication, farmer/worker profiles, job postings, and applications — all matched using location and skill logic

## 🗄️ Database Setup

This project uses Supabase (PostgreSQL). The full schema — including all tables and Row Level Security policies — is in [`supabase/schema.sql`](./supabase/schema.sql).

To set up your own instance:
1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Open the SQL Editor
3. Paste and run the contents of `supabase/schema.sql`

**Tables created:**
- `farmers` — farmer profiles linked to auth users
- `workers` — worker profiles linked to auth users
- `jobs` — job postings
- `applications` — worker job applications
- `crop_scans` — history of AI disease scans
- `ratings` — two-way trust ratings between farmers and workers

All tables use Row Level Security: public read access for matching, owner-only write access for profile data.
